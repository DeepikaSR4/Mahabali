									<p>I belonged to the Asura (demon) dynasty but was an ardent worshiper of Lord Vishnu. 
										My bravery and strength of character earned me the title of "Mahabali Chakravarthy" or Mahabali - the King of Kings. Everybody was happy in the kingdom, there was no discrimination based on caste or class. Rich and poor were equally treated. There was neither crime nor corruption. People did not even lock their doors, as there were no thieves in that kingdom. There was no poverty, sorrow, or disease in the reign of King Mahabali and everybody was happy and content.
										Looking at my growing popularity  Gods became extremely concerned and jealous. They felt threatened about their supremacy and began to think of a strategy to get rid of the dilemma.
										To curb the growth of my reign and maintain their supremacy, Aditi, the mother of Gods sought the help of Lord Vishnu (the preserver in the Hindu trinity) whom I worshiped. I was very generous and charitable. Lord Vishnu disguised himself as a dwarf and a poor Brahmin called Vamana. He came to the Kingdom, just after I performed my morning prayers and was preparing to grant boons to Brahmins. Disguised as Vamana, Vishnu said he was a poor Brahmin and asked for a piece of land. I said he could have as much land as he wanted. The Brahmin said that he just wanted as much land as could be covered by his three steps. I was surprised to hear but agreed. A learned adviser of the mine, Shukracharya sensed that Vamana was not an ordinary person and warned me against making the promise. But, I replied that it would be a sin for a King to back on his words and asked the Brahmin to take the land. I could not imagine that the dwarf Brahmin was Lord Vishnu himself
										Just as King I agreed to grant the land, Vamana began to expand and eventually increased himself to the size of cosmic proportions. With his first step, the Brahmin boy covered the whole of the earth, and with the other, he covered the whole of the skies. He then asked King Mahabali where is the space for him to keep his third foot.
										The King realized that he was not an ordinary Brahmin and his third step will destroy the earth. I folded my palms and bowed before Vamana and asked him to place his last step on his head so that he could keep the promise. The Brahmin placed his foot on my head, which pushed me to Patala, the nether world. There I requested the Brahmin to reveal his true identity. Lord Vishnu then appeared before the King in his person. The Lord told me that he came to test me and I  won the test. I was pleased to Lord Vishnu, he also granted a boon to the King. I was so much attached to my Kingdom and people that I requested that I should be allowed to visit Kerala once a year. Lord Vishnu was pleased to grant the wish. </p>
